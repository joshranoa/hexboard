# Deploy template

This deploy template will create the objects necessary for app deployment on the OpenShift cluster. 

There is also an example 'params' file which will need to be configured with the desired settings. If you want to deploy to multiple projects/stages, create multiple 'params' files for each namespace with the correct parameters set.
